            I'm a frontend developer with a passion for building clean,
            user-centric websites and web apps. I focus on crafting interactive
            and accessible UI using modern tools like React and Material UI.

            Iâ€™m currently interning at a startup where Iâ€™ve worked on real-world
            projects, collaborated with agile teams, and sharpened my skills in
            component-based architecture, animations, and responsive design.

            I enjoy learning new technologies and continuously improving my
            work. Whether itâ€™s creating smooth UI interactions, writing clean
            code, or experimenting with animations â€” I aim to deliver
            experiences that people love to use.
